This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# 1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(.~cty)
# A. The continuous variable is converted to a categorical variable, and the plot contains a facet for each distinct value.
```

```{r}
# 2. What do the empty cells in a plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
# The empty cells (facets) in this plot are combinations of drv and cyl that have no observations.
# These are the same locations in the scatter plot of drv and cyl that have no points.
```

```{r}
# 3. What plots does the following code make? What does . do?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
# drv ~ . facet by values of drv on the y-axis
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
# . ~ cyl facet by values of cyl on the x-axis
```

```{r}
# 4. Take the first faceted plot in this section:
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
# What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might
# the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

```

```{r}
# 5. Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the 
# individual panels? Why doesnâ€™t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol variables?
?facet_wrap()
?facet_grid()
# A. it refers to the number of rows and columns; as.table and switch; facet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column faceting variables
```

```{r}
# 6. When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?
# A. There will be more space for columns if the plot is laid out horizontally
