This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* ?utton within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file?containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does ?ot run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# 1. What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

ggp?ot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = 'jitter')

# A. Overplotting is when the data or labels in a data visualization overlap, making it difficult to see individual data points in a data visualization. You need to specif? position = 'jitter' to add random noise around each dots.
```

```{r}
# 2. What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?
?geom_jitter()
# A. width and height control the amount of vertical and horizontal jitter.
```

```{r}
# 3. Compar? and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count()
?geom_jitter()
?geom_count()
# A. The jitter geom is a convenient shortcut for geom_point(position = "jitter"). It adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, and is a useful way of h?ndling overplotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.
# This is a variant geom_point() that counts the number of observations at each location, then maps the count to point area. It useful when you have discrete data and overplotting.
ggplot(data?= mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_count()
```

```{r}
# 4. What's the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.
?geom_boxplot()
?position_dodge2()
# A. Dodging preserves t?e vertical position of an geom while adjusting the horizontal position. position_dodge2() works with bars and rectangles, but is particulary useful for arranging box plots, which can have variable widths
ggplot2 :: mpg
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = ?rv, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(dodge2 = 'jitter')
